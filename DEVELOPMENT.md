# Class Flow Development Workflow

## ðŸŽ¯ Repository Structure

### Main Branches
- `main`: Stable base product releases
- `development`: Active development branch
- `client-{name}`: Client-specific customizations

### Client Branch Strategy
Each client gets their own branch from main:
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b client-abc-school
# Customize for ABC School
# Deploy client-specific version
```

## ðŸš€ Development Workflow

### 1. Base Product Development
```bash
# Work on new features
git checkout development
git add .
git commit -m "âœ¨ Add new feature"
git push origin development

# Merge to main when stable
git checkout main
git merge development
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin main --tags
```

### 2. Client Customization
```bash
# Create client branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b client-xyz-academy

# Create client folder
mkdir clients/xyz-academy
cp school_timetable_planner_new.py clients/xyz-academy/
cp config.json clients/xyz-academy/

# Customize for client
# - Add license system
# - Custom branding
# - Client-specific features

git add .
git commit -m "ðŸŽ¨ XYZ Academy customization - v1.0.0-xyz"
git push origin client-xyz-academy
```

### 3. Client Deployment
```bash
cd clients/xyz-academy
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name="XYZ-TimetablePlanner" school_timetable_planner_new.py
# Deploy dist/XYZ-TimetablePlanner.exe to client
```

## ðŸ”§ Future Client Features Implementation

### License System (30-day trial)
```python
# Add to main file
import datetime
import hashlib
import os

class LicenseManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trial_days = 30
        self.license_file = "license.dat"
    
    def check_trial(self):
        # Implementation for trial validation
        pass
    
    def activate_license(self, key):
        # Implementation for license activation
        pass
```

### Admin Screen
```python
class AdminPanel:
    def __init__(self, parent):
        self.parent = parent
        self.setup_admin_ui()
    
    def setup_admin_ui(self):
        # Admin interface implementation
        pass
    
    def manage_users(self):
        # User management functionality
        pass
```

### Mobile Contact Management
```python
class ContactManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contacts_db = "contacts.db"
    
    def add_teacher_contact(self, teacher_id, mobile, email):
        # Contact management implementation
        pass
    
    def update_mobile_number(self, teacher_id, new_mobile):
        # Mobile update functionality
        pass
```
