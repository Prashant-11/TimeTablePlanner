# Teacher Class-Section Restrictions Feature

## 🎯 **New Feature Overview**

ClassFlow now supports **Teacher Class-Section Restrictions** - a powerful feature that allows schools to restrict which teachers can teach specific class-section combinations.

### **Example Use Cases:**
- **Ram** should only teach **Class 1 Section A and B**
- **Priya** can teach **Class 5 all sections** but not other classes
- **Mathematics teachers** restricted to **senior classes only (Class 8-10)**
- **Primary teachers** limited to **junior classes (Class 1-5)**

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Database Enhancement**
- **New Table**: `teacher_restrictions`
- **Schema**: `(teacher, class, section)` combinations
- **Logic**: If no restrictions exist for a teacher, they can teach anywhere
- **Enforcement**: Restrictions apply to all teacher selection dropdowns and auto-assignment

### **2. User Interface**
- **New Button**: "Teacher Restrictions" in main toolbar
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tab for each teacher
- **Checkbox Grid**: Select allowed class-section combinations per teacher
- **Intuitive Design**: Easy to set up and modify restrictions

### **3. Smart Filtering**
- **Subject + Restrictions**: Teachers filtered by both subject expertise AND class-section permissions
- **Auto-Assignment**: Respects both subject mapping and class restrictions
- **Real-time Updates**: Dropdowns update immediately when subjects change
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling when no suitable teacher available

## 📋 **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Set Up Teacher Restrictions**
1. Click **"Teacher Restrictions"** button in main toolbar
2. Select teacher tab (e.g., "Ram")
3. Check class-section combinations they can teach:
   - ✅ Class 1 - Section A
   - ✅ Class 1 - Section B
   - ❌ Class 2 - Section A (unchecked)
4. Click **"Save & Close"**

### **Step 2: Normal Timetable Creation**
1. Select subject in any period slot
2. Teacher dropdown automatically shows only:
   - Teachers who can teach the selected subject AND
   - Teachers allowed for that specific class-section
3. Auto-assign function respects both restrictions

### **Step 3: Verification**
- Teachers not allowed for a class-section won't appear in dropdowns
- Auto-assignment will never assign restricted teachers
- Manual overrides still possible for emergency situations

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Functions**
```python
def get_teacher_restrictions(teacher)
def can_teacher_teach_class_section(teacher, class_name, section)
def filter_teachers_by_restrictions(teachers, class_name, section)
```

### **Integration Points**
- **Grid Creation**: Initial teacher dropdowns filtered by restrictions
- **Subject Change**: Live filtering when subjects are selected
- **Auto-Assignment**: All assignment logic respects restrictions
- **Smart Match**: Enhanced matching algorithm

### **Filtering Logic**
1. **Start with**: All teachers who can teach the subject
2. **Filter by**: Class-section restrictions for that specific cell
3. **Result**: Only suitable teachers appear in dropdown
4. **Fallback**: If no restrictions set, teacher can teach anywhere
