# ClassFlow - Date/Time and Week Calculation Fix

## üö® **Issue Identified**
The application was showing "Current Week: 32" which was incorrect for the academic context and confusing for users. The ISO week calculation was not appropriate for school timetabling.

## üîß **Problems Fixed**

### 1. **Incorrect Week Calculation**
**Problem**: Using ISO week number (`datetime.now().isocalendar()[1]`) which gives calendar weeks
**Issue**: ISO week 32 for August 10, 2025 is not meaningful for academic scheduling
**Solution**: Implemented academic week calculation based on academic year start

### 2. **Missing Date/Time Context**
**Problem**: Only showed week number without date context
**Issue**: Users couldn't see current date, time, or understand the week reference
**Solution**: Added comprehensive date/time display in header

## üìÖ **New Academic Week Calculation**

### **Logic Implemented:**
```python
# Academic year starts in August
if now.month >= 8:  # August or later in academic year
    academic_start = datetime(now.year, 8, 1)  # August 1st
else:  # January to July, previous academic year
    academic_start = datetime(now.year - 1, 8, 1)  # Previous August 1st

days_since_start = (now - academic_start).days
self.current_week = (days_since_start // 7) + 1  # Academic week
```

### **For August 10, 2025:**
- **Academic Year Start**: August 1, 2025
- **Days Since Start**: 9 days (August 1 to August 10)
- **Academic Week**: Week 2 (much more meaningful than ISO week 32)

## üé® **Enhanced Header Display**

### **Before:**
```
Class Flow                          Current Week: 32    beta release
```

### **After:**
```
Class Flow                          August 10, 2025     beta release
                                   2:30 PM
                                   Academic Week: 2
```

## üìä **New Features Added**

### 1. **Real-Time Date Display**
- **Format**: "August 10, 2025"
- **Position**: Top-right of header
- **Font**: Bold, yellow text (#ffe082)

### 2. **Live Time Clock**
- **Format**: "2:30 PM" (12-hour format)
- **Updates**: Every 60 seconds automatically
- **Position**: Below date
- **Font**: White text

### 3. **Academic Week Number**
- **Format**: "Academic Week: 2"
- **Calculation**: Based on academic year starting August 1st
- **Position**: Below time
- **Font**: Yellow text (#ffe082)

### 4. **Auto-Updating Time**
- **Function**: `update_time()` method
- **Frequency**: Updates every minute
- **Persistence**: Continues throughout application usage

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Initialization Updates:**
```python
# Calculate academic week
now = datetime.now()
if now.month >= 8:
    academic_start = datetime(now.year, 8, 1)
else:
    academic_start = datetime(now.year - 1, 8, 1)

days_since_start = (now - academic_start).days
self.current_week = (days_since_start // 7) + 1

# Store formatted date/time strings
self.current_date_str = now.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
self.current_time_str = now.strftime("%I:%M %p")
```

### **Header Layout Updates:**
```python
# Date and time info frame
datetime_frame = tk.Frame(header_frame, bg="#2d6cdf")
datetime_frame.pack(side='right', padx=(10, 20), pady=(10, 0))

# Individual labels for date, time, and week
date_label = tk.Label(datetime_frame, text=f"{self.current_date_str}", ...)
self.time_label = tk.Label(datetime_frame, text=f"{self.current_time_str}", ...)
week_label = tk.Label(datetime_frame, text=f"Academic Week: {self.current_week}", ...)
```

### **Live Updates:**
```python
def update_time(self):
    """Update the time display every minute"""
    now = datetime.now()
    new_time_str = now.strftime("%I:%M %p")
    if hasattr(self, 'time_label'):
        self.time_label.config(text=new_time_str)
    # Schedule next update in 60 seconds
    self.root.after(60000, self.update_time)
```
