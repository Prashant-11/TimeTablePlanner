# ClassFlow - Subject-Teacher Mapping Improvements

## üéØ **New Features Implemented**

### 1. **Smart Teacher Filtering**
- **Subject-Based Filtering**: Teacher dropdowns now show only teachers who are mapped to teach the selected subject
- **Dynamic Updates**: When a subject is selected, the teacher dropdown automatically updates to show relevant teachers
- **Fallback Logic**: If no teachers are mapped to a subject, all teachers are shown as fallback

### 2. **Editable Cells with Blank Options**
- **Blank Entries Allowed**: Both subject and teacher cells can now be left blank
- **Manual Entry**: Users can type custom entries in addition to dropdown selections
- **Flexible Assignment**: No longer forced to assign every period

### 3. **Enhanced Auto-Assign Function**
- **Respects Mapping**: Auto-assign now prioritizes teachers who are properly mapped to subjects
- **Updates Dropdowns**: When auto-assigning, teacher dropdowns are updated to show only relevant teachers
- **Better Distribution**: Improved algorithm to distribute teachers more evenly

### 4. **Improved Teacher Leave Management**
- **Subject-Aware Substitutes**: Substitute teacher dropdown filters to show only teachers who can teach the required subjects
- **Multi-Subject Analysis**: Shows all subjects that need coverage when a teacher is on leave
- **Smart Recommendations**: Prioritizes substitute teachers who can cover multiple subjects

## üîß **Technical Changes Made**

### **Timetable Grid Updates:**
```python
# Before: Fixed dropdown with all teachers
teacher_cb = ttk.Combobox(frame, values=self.config['teachers'])

# After: Dynamic filtering based on subject
def on_subject_change():
    selected_subject = subj_var.get()
    if selected_subject:
        # Filter teachers who can teach this subject
        available_teachers = [teacher for teacher, subjects in teacher_subjects.items() 
                            if selected_subject in subjects]
        teacher_cb['values'] = [""] + available_teachers
```

### **Key Improvements:**
1. **Subject Change Handler**: Added event binding to update teacher dropdown when subject changes
2. **Blank Options**: Added empty string ("") as first option in all dropdowns
3. **Manual Entry**: Removed 'readonly' state from subject dropdown to allow typing
4. **Load Function Update**: When loading saved data, teacher dropdowns are updated based on loaded subjects
5. **Leave Management**: Substitute teacher filtering based on required subjects

## üéÆ **How to Use New Features**

### **Setting Up Teacher-Subject Mapping:**
1. Click **"Teacher Mapping"** button in the main interface
2. For each teacher, enter subjects they can teach (comma-separated)
3. Example: `Math, Science, Physics`
4. Click **"Save Mapping"** to apply changes

### **Creating Timetables:**
1. **Select Subject**: Choose from dropdown or type custom subject
2. **Teacher Auto-Filters**: Only teachers who can teach the selected subject will appear
3. **Leave Blank**: Select empty option to leave periods unassigned
4. **Manual Override**: Type custom teacher names if needed

### **Managing Teacher Leave:**
1. Select teacher and day for leave
2. **Smart Analysis**: System shows subjects that need coverage
3. **Filtered Substitutes**: Dropdown shows only teachers who can cover required subjects
4. **Multi-Subject Coverage**: Prioritizes teachers who can handle multiple subjects

## üìä **Benefits**

### **For School Administrators:**
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Errors**: Teachers are only assigned to subjects they can teach
- ‚úÖ **Faster Planning**: Smart filtering speeds up timetable creation
- ‚úÖ **Better Substitutes**: Leave management suggests appropriate replacement teachers
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Scheduling**: Option to leave periods blank for special arrangements

### **For Users:**
- ‚úÖ **Intuitive Interface**: Dropdowns show only relevant options
- ‚úÖ **Less Clicking**: Auto-filtering reduces manual searching
- ‚úÖ **Professional Results**: Ensures qualified teachers are assigned to appropriate subjects
- ‚úÖ **Error Prevention**: System guides users to make appropriate assignments

## üîÑ **Backward Compatibility**

- ‚úÖ **Existing Data**: All previously created timetables load correctly
- ‚úÖ **No Mapping Required**: If no teacher-subject mapping exists, system shows all teachers (previous behavior)
- ‚úÖ **Same Interface**: All existing features work exactly as before
- ‚úÖ **Gradual Adoption**: Can use new features progressively without disrupting current workflow

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **Recommended Usage Workflow:**
1. **Initial Setup**: Configure teacher-subject mapping for your school
2. **Create Templates**: Use auto-assign with new smart filtering
3. **Fine-tune**: Manually adjust assignments as needed
4. **Manage Changes**: Use improved leave management for substitute assignments

### **Advanced Features:**
- Teacher mapping can be updated anytime without affecting existing timetables
- Multiple subjects per teacher supported (comma-separated)
- Smart conflict detection still works with new filtering
- Export functions include all new data correctly

## üìù **Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "teacher_subjects": {
    "John Smith": ["Math", "Physics", "Science"],
    "Sarah Johnson": ["English", "Literature", "History"],
    "Mike Brown": ["Science", "Chemistry", "Biology"],
    "Lisa Davis": ["Math", "Computer Science"],
    "Tom Wilson": ["Geography", "History", "Social Studies"]
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that:
- Math classes only show John Smith and Lisa Davis
- Science classes show John Smith and Mike Brown
- English classes only show Sarah Johnson
- History classes show Sarah Johnson and Tom Wilson
