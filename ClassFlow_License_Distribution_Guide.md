    if not key or len(key) < 20:
        return False
    
    key = key.upper().strip()
    
    # Format validation (CFPRO-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX)
    if not key.startswith("CFPRO-"):
        return False
    
    # Demo keys for testing
    valid_keys = [
        "CFPRO-DEMO1-TRIAL-2025A-ACTIV",
        "CFPRO-SCHOL-BASIC-PREM1-UNLIM",
        "CFPRO-INST1-ADVANCE-FULL2-ACTIV"
    ]
    
    if key in valid_keys:
        self.license_data["license_type"] = "PREMIUM"
        self.license_data["license_key"] = key
        self.save_license(self.license_data)
        return True
    
    # Add online validation API call here
